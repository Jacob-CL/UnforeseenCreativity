# Broken Authentication
- - The most widespread authentication method in web applications is login forms, where users enter their username and password to prove their identity.
- - [Enumerating users with SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Usernames)
  - An example of a side channel is the response timing.
  - When enumerating users, youre probably doing it against index.php
  - Another reminder to run everything twice, and to use different tools. They aren't always reliable
