### Have a web traffic port?
  - Is it accessible? What are the response codes and headers?
    - `curl -s -I -L http://<IP>` 
  - Is there a robots.txt?
    - `curl http://<IP>/robots.txt`
  - What service is running behind it? Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat?
    - See above NMAP scan
  - Can you DNS zone transfer? (need domain name)
    - `dig @ns1.example.com example.com axfr`
    - `dig axfr <DOMAIN_NAME_TO_TRANSFER> @<DNS_IP>`
  - Are they any hidden directories? (google.com/XYZ)
    - `ffuf -u http://<IP>/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`
    - `gobuster dir -u http://<IP> -w wordlist.txt`
    - `dirb http://<IP>/ wordlist.txt`
  - Are there any hidden subdomains? (XYZ.google.com - Remember to add subdomains to your hosts file as you discover them.)
    - `ffuf -u http://FUZZ.example.com -w subdomains.txt -fs 404`
    - `dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f wordlist.txt`
    - `subfinder -d <DOMAIN>`
  - What is the domain name of the ip?
    - `nslookup <IP_ADDRESS>`
  - Can you see any outdated software or known vulnerabilities?
    - See above NMAP scan or `nmap --script vuln <IP>` | `nikto -h http://<IP>`
  - Can you see any subdomains in the CT logs?
    - `curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[] | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value' | sort -u`
  - Is there an SSL/TLS Certificate? Self-signed? And what domains does it cover?
    - `sslscan <IP>:443`
    - `openssl s_client -connect <IP>:443`
   - What kind of authN is there? Can you brute force?
    - `medusa -h <IP> -U userlist.txt -P passlist.txt -M http`
    - `hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt <IP> http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid"`
  - Are there API endpoints? Look for `/api`, `/graphql`, `/swagger`, `/openapi.json`
    - `gobuster dir -u http://<IP> -w api-wordlist.txt`
  - Is there the oppurtunity for SQL Injection, XXS, SSRF or command injection?
  - Can you check cookies and session management? Are they `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`?
  - Can you find a vhost? (Look at the `host` header - does the request hostname match the response hostname?)
    - Add all subdomains/vhosts to hosts file and enumarate again - they can be nested.
    - `ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:PORT/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb'`
  - Is there a WAF?
    - `wafw00f inlanefreight.com`
    - `nikto -h inlanefreight.com `
  - Have you find anything by web crawling?
    -  `python3 ReconSpider.py http://inlanefreight.com`
  - Is there anything on [WebArchive / Waybackmachine?](https://web.archive.org)
