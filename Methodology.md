# Web Application Penetration Testing Methodology

---

## **1. Reconnaissance & Information Gathering**
### **Objectives:**
- **Identifying Assets**: Uncovering all publicly accessible components of the target, such as web pages, subdomains, IP addresses, and technologies used. This step provides a comprehensive overview of the target's online presence.
-** Discovering Hidden Information**: Locating sensitive information that might be inadvertently exposed, including backup files, configuration files, or internal documentation. These findings can reveal valuable insights and potential entry points for attacks.
- **Analysing the Attack Surface**: Examining the target's attack surface to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This involves assessing the technologies used, configurations, and possible entry points for exploitation.
- **Gathering Intelligence**: Collecting information that can be leveraged for further exploitation or social engineering attacks. This includes identifying key personnel, email addresses, or patterns of behaviour that could be exploited.

#### Active Reconnaissance
| Technique | Description | Example | Tools | Risk of Detection |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|------------------|
| **Port Scanning** | Identifying open ports and services running on the target. | Using Nmap to scan a web server for open ports like 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). | `Nmap`, `Masscan`, `Unicornscan` | **High**: Direct interaction with the target can trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls. |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Probing the target for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or misconfigurations. | Running Nessus against a web application to check for SQL injection flaws or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. | `Nessus`, `OpenVAS`, `Nikto` | **High**: Vulnerability scanners send exploit payloads that security solutions can detect. |
| **Network Mapping** | Mapping the target's network topology, including connected devices and their relationships. | Using traceroute to determine the path packets take to reach the target server, revealing potential network hops and infrastructure. | `Traceroute`, `Nmap` | **Medium to High**: Excessive or unusual network traffic can raise suspicion. |
| **Banner Grabbing** | Retrieving information from banners displayed by services running on the target. | Connecting to a web server on port 80 and examining the HTTP banner to identify the web server software and version. | `Netcat`, `curl` | **Low**: Banner grabbing typically involves minimal interaction but can still be logged. |
| **OS Fingerprinting** | Identifying the operating system running on the target. | Using Nmap's OS detection capabilities (`-O`) to determine if the target is running Windows, Linux, or another OS. | `Nmap`, `Xprobe2` | **Low**: OS fingerprinting is usually passive, but some advanced techniques can be detected. |
| **Service Enumeration** | Determining the specific versions of services running on open ports. | Using Nmap's service version detection (`-sV`) to determine if a web server is running Apache 2.4.50 or Nginx 1.18.0. | `Nmap` | **Low**: Similar to banner grabbing, service enumeration can be logged but is less likely to trigger alerts. |
| **Web Spidering** | Crawling the target website to identify web pages, directories, and files. | Running a web crawler like Burp Suite Spider or OWASP ZAP Spider to map out the structure of a website and discover hidden resources. | `Burp Suite Spider`, `OWASP ZAP Spider`, `Scrapy` (customizable) | **Low to Medium**: Can be detected if the crawler's behavior is not carefully configured to mimic legitimate traffic. |
